# PythonMagicSquare
This is a python script that reads a text file and verifies if the content is a magic square or not.

A magic square is a square containing a number of integers arranged so that the sum of the numbers is the same in each row, column, and main diagonal and often in some or all of the other diagonals.

This script runs counts and calculations to verify txt files containing magic squares.

NOTE: The txt file must be in the same directory as the script.
